# Little Readers

## Concept & Motivation
The concept behind our project started with originated with the teams experience working with children in the education field. The  idea was to create an online learning tool that included live “read aloud books” which could be used by children of all ages, levels, and capabilities.

As I’m sure is true for many of us, our exposure to technology started very young, which is what peaked our interest in the technology field. One of my earliest childhood memories was installing computer games at a very young age much to my parents suprise, and playing Mavis Beacon and Carmen San Diego in school. That was almost 30 years ago! Kids have continued to get more and more digital, and with it, the edutainment market has boomed.
